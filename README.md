# Battleship Tracker Challenge

I have created a console application to for the Battleship tracker challenge.

There are some default settings stored in appsettings.json which can be changed as per the user. 

The console application will be asking initial questions to setup board, add ship before you can attack on the board.

The solution consists of console project and unit test project. 
After you download, make sure the "BattleshipTracker" is marked as start-up project.
Build the solution and start playing!!!
